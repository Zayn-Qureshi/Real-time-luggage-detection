Features
Real-time luggage detection using deep learning.
Automated alert generation for security teams.
Scalable and modular design for easy deployment.
Database integration for logging detected incidents.
System Architecture
The project follows a Layered Architecture:

Presentation Layer: User interface for monitoring detections and alerts.
Business Logic Layer: AI-powered detection and alerting system.
Data Layer: Stores detection logs and alerts for security tracking.
